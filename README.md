My third capstone is a website/app to help people connect to information about planets in our solar system entering and exiting stages of retrograde. Users can access a page that show all of the other planets and whether or not they are in retrograde. Users can access another page where they can select a date in the future and find out if it falls in any planets retrograde periods. Users can also visit a page that gives reports on each planet to see their upcoming retrograde periods for the next five years.
